# Start Overlay in Application View for Gnome 40+:
When activating overview (Super button), the application view is shown instead of the view with the windows. This is a updated version of the extension Start Overlay in Application View created by tmk (https://extensions.gnome.org/accounts/profile/tmk), also i'd like to thanks user JustPerfection (https://extensions.gnome.org/accounts/profile/JustPerfection) for helping me on this extension.
## Expected behavior:
After hitting Super key, instead of display overview:\

Applications view is displayed in it's place:\

## Manual instalation:
For manual installation, just paste the folder containing the extension.js and metadata.js files (start-overlay-in-application-view@Hex_cz) at ".local/share/gnome-shell/extensions" folder, then restart your gnome-shell or simply end your session and enter again. After that the extension should appear on extensions manager.
